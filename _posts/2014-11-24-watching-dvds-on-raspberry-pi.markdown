If you want watching DVDs on your [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) with an installed [OpenELEC](https://openelec.tv), [Raspbmc](https://www.raspbmc.com) or [XBian](https://xbian.org) you must buy a [MPEG-2](https://www.raspberrypi.com) licence. But not afraid, it's only a minimal amount.

To get your licence you need the device's internal 16-digit serial number (not the number printed on your board).

So go to your favorite console and connect your Raspberry Pi through ssh (I show you the steps by using [Cmder](https://cmder.app/), a Raspberry Pi B+ and an installed OpenELEC image).

```bash
λ ssh root@192.168.1.19
root@192.168.1.19's password: XYZ

##############################################

OpenELEC (official) Version: 4.2.1

OpenELEC:~ # cat /proc/cpuinfo

processor       : 0
model name      : ARMv6-compatible processor rev 7 (v6l)
Features        : swp half thumb fastmult vfp edsp java tls
CPU implementer : 0x41
CPU architecture: 7
CPU variant     : 0x0
CPU part        : 0xb76
CPU revision    : 7

Hardware        : BCM2708
Revision        : 0010
Serial          : 00000000XXXXXXXX <-- the serial number

OpenELEC:~ #
```
> Another way to get the serial number is: `SYSTEM`->`Systeminfo`->`Hardware`

Now you can buy your licence at [raspberrypi.com](https://www.raspberrypi.com) with this serial number and put the licence keys in the config.txt of your linux distribution.

To do this on `OpenELEC` (connected via ssh) follow these steps:

1. remount the `/flash` folder as read write

```bash
OpenELEC:~ # mount /flash -o remount,rw
```

2. now it's possible to edit the file with `nano` (a light weight console based text editor)

```bash
OpenELEC:~ # nano /flash/config.txt
```

3. scroll to the bottom of the file at replace the zero filled licences with your one and save the file by typing `CTRL-X` and typing `Y`.

```bash

################################################################################

# decode_MPG2=0x00000000
# decode_WVC1=0x00000000
# decode_DTS=0x00000000
# decode_DDP=0x00000000
```

4. now make sure the changes are written to your SD card

```bash
OpenELEC:~ # sync
```

5. finally remount the file system as read only and reboot your Raspberry Pi.

```bash
OpenELEC:~ # mount /flash -o remount,ro
OpenELEC:~ # reboot
```

Restart your raspi and have fun!

That's it!
