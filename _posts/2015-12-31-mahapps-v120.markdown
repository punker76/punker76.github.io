I want say thank you to all awesome [users, testers and contributors](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/graphs/contributors). It was a cool year of MahApps (used at Build 2015, published in [magazine](http://www.dotnetpro.de/), published on [pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com) with this awesome [course](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/mahappsdotmetro-creating-modern-wpf-apps) by [Mark Heath](http://mark-dot-net.blogspot.de/p/about-me.html)).

So I think it's time for a new release after over 76000 downloads for v1.1.2!!!

And here is it
