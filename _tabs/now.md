## Short bio

Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jan. I'm a dad with 3 wonderful kids. I'm living and working in Germany by [Aachen](https://goo.gl/maps/YVPxbSf9SA42), but I was born in east Germany [GDR](https://goo.gl/maps/Epnt9NBgNZp). So Yes, I'm also a refugee!

Since January 2015 I have [Diabetes mellitus type 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1) which was diagnosed by pure accident. I'm using a pump from [Ypsomed](https://www.ypsomed.com/) and the [FreeStyle Libre 3](https://www.freestylelibre.de/). Now I'm using also the [CamAPS FX](https://camdiab.com/) advanced adaptive hybrid closed-loop app.

In my spare free time I'm working on some #OSS projects, try to run some kilometers or using my Editor bike from Cube.
