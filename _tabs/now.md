## Short bio

Hey, I'm Jan. I'm a husband with 3 wonderful kids and an amazing wife (and a dog, 2 cats...). I'm living and working in Germany by [Aachen](https://goo.gl/maps/YVPxbSf9SA42), but I was born in east Germany [GDR](https://goo.gl/maps/Epnt9NBgNZp). So Yes, I'm also a refugee!

Since January 2015 I have [Diabetes mellitus type 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1) which was diagnosed by pure accident. I'm using a pump from [Ypsomed](https://www.ypsomed.com/) and the [Dexcom G6 CGM](https://www.dexcom.com/) system.

My day time goes on these things:

- Family first
- [Work](https://www.inform-software.com/)
- Family
- [Open source projects](https://github.com/)
- Family
